Just the Docs uses [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com) to add a client-side search interface powered by a JSON index that Jekyll generates.
All search results are shown in an auto-complete style interface (there is no search results page).
By default, all generated HTML pages are indexed using the following data points:

- Page title
- Page content
- Page URL


### Search granularity

Pages are split into sections that can be searched individually.
The sections are defined by the headings on the page.
